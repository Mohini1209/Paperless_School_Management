                    Wisdom Public School was founded in the year 1983 by Prof. Vishwanath D. Karad 
                    (Founder, Executive President and Director General), along with the collective
                     efforts of many educationists, scientists and social  thinkers. WPS is one of 
                     the first few private Public School in the state, now offering academic 
                     programs in various cities for over 500 students annually.
                     At Wisdom we aim to ensure that all children develop to their full potential
                      and that we prepare them for the opportunities and experiences for adult life.
                       We aim to achieve this by providing high quality teaching and learning in a happy, 
                       inclusive community.

                    the whole child, academically, intellectually, physically, emotionally and socially.</li>

                    balanced creative curriculum that develops the whole child.</li>
                           <li> We have high expectations for behaviour and achievement. If necessary we work
                     closely with parents whose child is experiencing difficulties.</li>
                           <li> We have a strong Governing Body who are committed to our vision and support

                     creed or ethnic origin. Where each person is valued and is made aware that they 
                     have the potential to make a positive contribution to the school.</li>
